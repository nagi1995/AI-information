# Before going into basics of python, we should ask Why python for AI?

## Here are the links for that question. 
## [Link1](https://technative.io/why-use-python-for-ai-and-machine-learning/#:~:text=Python%20code%20is%20reasonable%20by,the%20execution%20of%20various%20functionalities.), [Link2](https://www.cuelogic.com/blog/role-of-python-in-artificial-intelligence), [Link3](https://djangostars.com/blog/why-python-is-good-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/), [Link4](https://www.esparkinfo.com/why-python-is-used-for-ai-and-machine-learning.html)


# As we have known Why python, let us understand the basics of python

## [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) is the good source for python basics. [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) is another good source. Youtube video tutorial for beginners in [English1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMoshProgrammingwithMoshVerified), [English2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXeEoD0pB3E&list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3&ab_channel=TeluskoTelusko), [Telugu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hVzEKZQyMU&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMoshProgrammingwithMoshVerified), [Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTyI-M50Hu4&ab_channel=TeluskoTeluskoVerified). 

## And finally nothing beats the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) by python website itself. 

## It is good to go through in-built libraries provided by python. 

  * [string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html) - Common string operations
  * [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) - regex operations
  * [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) - Container datatypes
  * [pprint](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html) - Data pretty printer
  * [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) - Miscellaneous operating system interfaces
  * [shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html) - High-level file operations
  * [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) - Python object serialization
  * [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) - GUI toolkit

# Note: It is not necessary to remember all the functions and libraries. Most of them are just a Google search away. Just be precise with what you want.
