# [Here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/ide) is a list of popular IDEs/Code Editors.
# I have mostly used [jupyter-notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) which comes in [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution. 
# If the RAM of your desktop/laptop is less, then go for [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/) provided by Google for free (12GB RAM, 64 GB Disk). This is sufficient for most of the AI/ML/DL/DS tasks. Or else go for colab pro.
